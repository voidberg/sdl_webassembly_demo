# SDL WebAssembly demo

This is a small wip example of a game using SDL, working on the web via WebAssembly. It was used in a talk about WebAssembly at BucharestJS.

It is inspired by the ZX Spectrum game GlugGlug.

The various assets used are licensed using their original licenses listed in `graphics.txt`.

## Building
* `make` builds a Mac or Linux version.
* `make build_run` recompiles the project and runs it.
* `make web` creates a version for the web in `builds/web`.
